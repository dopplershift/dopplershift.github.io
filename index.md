## Interests
My background and degrees are in meteorology, with a focus on weather radar
algorithms and signal processing. Much of my open source contributions have
been directed at making it easier to use the Python tools work better for
use in meteorological analysis. Besides this, I'm interested in data
visualization, signal processing, and machine learning--basically anything
to help extract additional useful information from data.

## Primary Languages
* Python
* C/C++
* Java
